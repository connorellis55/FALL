    <h1>ITS ALL NOISE</h1>
    <h2> MISSION STATEMENT </h2>
    <p> Wav News is a small, student run organization that tackles the news and history of music from many different time periods and places. It creates written and visual content that educates people while also giving students the ability to have a platform to practice journalism, writing, editing, managing, and producing. They are located in San Luis Obispo and they say that they want something that mimics old newscasts that preceded movies but with a modern feel.</p>
